Assignment: Homework 1

Description:
This is my submission for Homework 1.

Sample execution is java cs250.hw1.Operations <num1> <num2> <num3>
where <num1>, <num2>, <num3> are either decimal, binary, or hexadecimal integer strings in any order.
The program requires the user to enter exactly 3 arguments.

Binary numbers are entered with the prefix 0b-
Hexadecimal numbers are entered with the prefix 0x-
Decimal Integer numbers are entered without prefix.

The program executes a series of 8 tasks
Task 1 validates the correct number of arguments are entered.

Task 2 Identifies the number system entered.

Task 3 performs error checking validation on the arguments to ensure they are valid as per each numbering system.

Task 4 Converts each number argument into Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal

Task 5 Computes the one's complement of each number.

Task 6 Computes the two's complement of each number.

Task 7 Computes bitwise OR, AND, and XOR of the 3 numbers.

Task 8 Computes bitwise left and right shift of the numbers for 2 shifts.
