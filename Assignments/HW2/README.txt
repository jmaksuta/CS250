Assignment: Homework 2

Description:
This is my submission for Homework 2.
The program takes 3 arguments size, experiments, and seed.
Usage:
java cs250.hw2.Memory <size> <experiments> <seed>

It performs 3 tasks and writes their output to the console.
Task 1 analyzes the difference between caching and not caching
for the loop variable in a for loop calculating a running total.

Task 2 analyzes the differnce between accessing memory sequentially
in the first 10% of elements in an array and randomly from the last
10% of elements in the array.

Task 3 analyzes the difference between a TreeSet and LinkedList data
structures and the time it takes to search using the contains method
in each.
